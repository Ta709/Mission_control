# Mission Control Website

## Overview
The Mission Control Website is an interactive application that allows users to input the weight of a rocket and its thrust speed. The application calculates and displays the flight path of the rocket, including the angle of the rocket's tip and the physics involved in real-life rocket flight.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the `mission-control-website` directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

### Usage
1. Enter the weight of the rocket in the designated input field.
2. Enter the thrust speed of the rocket.
3. Click the "Calculate Flight Path" button.
4. The flight path and angle of the rocket will be displayed on the canvas.

## Physics Concepts
The application implements basic physics principles related to rocket flight, including:
- Newton's Second Law of Motion
- Thrust-to-weight ratio
- Trajectory calculations based on initial velocity and angle
